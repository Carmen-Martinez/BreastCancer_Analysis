# Capstone 1 Background
I have created a Jupyter Notebook using the Breast Cancer dataset from kaggle. Here I focuse on 'mutation count' and its affect on 3 survival outcomes. 

Ho = There is no difference in mutation count between survival outcome, on average.
Ha = There is a difference in muatation count between survival outcome, on average. 

I visualize my data using univariate and multivariate graphs and descriptive statistics to get a better understanding about the variables and the target variable (mutation count) as well as other exploratory data analysis. For statistical analysis I ran a Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U Test and calculated effect size.

I hope to utilize robust models to get a better picture of the relationship between my target variable and dependent variable.
